Rainbows are formed by refraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular rings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.\n",

But using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye (such as infrared) enables satellites to distinguish ice from ash and clouds. The Aqua satellite captured this false-color image in September 2016. Note the three bright white plumes running down the middle third of the page; they are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds (teal) around them.\n",
